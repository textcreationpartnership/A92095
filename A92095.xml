         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T will ſeeme ſtrange (no doubt) to ſee me in print, my knowne diſpoſition being ſo contrary to this ſcribling age; and ſure I had not put my ſelfe upon a Declaration, if in common prudence I could have done otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>I need not tell the world (for it is too well knowne) what malicious lying Pamphlets are printed againſt mee almoſt every morning, whereby thoſe buſie men ſtrive to render me as odious as they would have me, againſt whom doubtleſſe I had ſooner declared, but that I well knew this mutinous lying ſpirit would be eaſily convinced, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſilenced, which, as it ceaſeth at no time, ſo it ſpares no perſon. And this was too manifeſt to me, by thoſe bold, odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and impoſsible untruths forged againſt His ſacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, their owne King and Soveraigne (and my Gracious and Royall Uncle) who is onely guilty of this, that he is too good to be their King; and to deale clearly, this was it furniſhed me with ſufficient patience, thinking it but reaſonable, that I ſhould be ſlandered as well as His Majeſtie.</p>
            <p>But ſince it hath pleaſed my Lord <hi>Wharton</hi> to tell the whole City of <hi>London</hi> openly at Guild-hall, and ſince to tell it all the world in print, that one great cauſe of their preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation at <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> was the barbarouſneſſe and inhumanity of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:158320:3"/>Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and his Troopers, that we ſpared neither man, woman, nor child, and the thing which we aime at is pillage and plundering, and the way which we would come by it is murthering and deſtroying; ſince ſuch a charge as this comes from ſuch a mouth, I hold my ſelfe bound in honour to ſpeak and tell that Lord, that as much of his ſpeech as concernes mee, is no truer then the reſt of it, which for the moſt part is as falſe as any thing that hath been ſpoken or printed in <hi>London</hi> theſe two yeares: and had I knowne his Lordſhips in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, I would have asked his reaſon either before or now at <hi>Keinton,</hi> if his Lordſhip had but ſtayed ſo long as to be asked the queſtion.</p>
            <p>But me thinke I heare the credulous people ſay, What? was not the Kings Standard reſcued from them by force? were there ſo many as 20. of our men killed by all the Kings Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons? was not our right wing long under the power of their Canons, ſo as ſome 17. ſhot of Canon ſhot againſt them, and yet not a man of ours ſo much as hurt? Nay, were there not 3000. ſlaine of the Kings Army, and but 300. of ours? If theſe abominable untruths (with many more like them in his Lordſhips ſpeech) be all true, then ſhall he freely charge me with barbarouſneſſe and inhumanity; but if theſe be moſt groſſe falſities (as many thouſand worthy Gentlemen will take their oathes they are, then I muſt profeſſe I am ſorry that any Baron of the Engliſh Nation ſhould utter ſuch fowl untruths, to deceive the poore abuſed Citizens of <hi>London</hi> with falſe reports, and ſo ſlander us. Twas ever my opinion, that no valiant man would ſpeake a knowne untruth; nor can I blame his Lordſhip or any others faint-heartedneſſe in ſo bad a cauſe as theirs is, which doubtleſſe is the reaſon why ſuch Noblemen and Gentry in His Majeſties Army, who hitherto had ſpent all their daies in peace, could then fight ſo valiantly <hi>ex tempore,</hi> not valuing their lives, and forgetting their deareſt relations; ſo as our enemies in their hackney railing Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets were forced to ſay, <hi>The Cavaliers</hi> (to give the Divell his due) <hi>fought very valiantly:</hi> And indeed, had they not ſhewed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:158320:3"/>rather too much valour, our enemies had had leſſe bottome whereon to ſound any untruths, whereof I take this relation to be one of their maſter-pieces of forgeries, for that they ſlew as many of ours, as we did of theirs, is as true, as that they beat us at <hi>Sherbourne Caſtle</hi> and at <hi>Worcester.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for barbarouſneſſe and inhumanity to women and children, wherewith his Lordſhip and thoſe impudent unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed papers cried daily in the ſtreets do continually ſlander us, I muſt here profeſſe, that I take that man to be no Souldier or Gentleman, that will ſtrike (much leſſe kill) a woman or a child, if it be in his power to doe the contrary: And I open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dare the moſt valiant and quick-ſighted of that lying Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to name the time, the perſon, or the houſe, where any child or woman loſt ſo much as a haire from their head by me, or any of our ſouldiers. In a battell, where two Armies fight, many one hath unfortunately killed his deareſt friend, very often thoſe whom willingly hee would otherwiſe have ſpared; and vvhether any woman or child were killed in this fight is more then I can juſtly ſay: I am ſorry if there were. I ſpeak not how wilfully barbatous their ſouldiers were to the Counteſſe <hi>Rivers,</hi> to the Lady <hi>Lucas</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and likewiſe to the like perſons of quality in <hi>Kent,</hi> and other places: Whom have wee ever puniſhed for ſpeaking againſt us, as they moſt Jewiſhly whipped to death a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> for ſaying no more then what was included in His Majeſties Proclamation. But ſince they name plundering, whoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies? nay, whoſe Armes have we taken away, unleſſe theirs, who actually had, or at leaſt declared they would uſe them againſt His Majeſties Army? And for that little cloth bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed for our ſouldiers (vvherewith their Pamphlets make ſuch a noiſe) His Majeſty by Gods help will ſee it better paid for, then any thing they have taken upon <hi>publick Faith.</hi> What houſe have we ranſacked, as they did the Earle of <hi>Norhamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons?</hi> mangling and cutting in pieces rich chaires, beds, ſtooles and hangings; drinking as much and as long as they were able, then letting the reſt run out upon the floore, when as the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:158320:4"/>very Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his houſe at <hi>Chartley</hi> ſuffered not the leaſt damage by us. What Churches have we defaced, as they did at <hi>Canterbury, Oxford, Worceſter,</hi> and many other places? whoſe pockets have vve pickt ever to the value of three pence, under pretence of ſearching for letters, as they lately did in <hi>Glocesterſhire,</hi> and particularly this laſt week at <hi>Windſor</hi> and <hi>Vxbridge?</hi> Is it not their uſuall practice firſt to plunder a mans houſe of all plate and monies, and then impriſon him as a Delinquent, for no other fault, but becauſe he ſtood loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to his Prince; as if it vvere too little to take a mans eſt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>te, unleſſe alſo they rob him of his innocence?

               </gap>d many others (for ſo I am informed theſe men are) becauſe they preach that vvhich their conſcience tells them is the knowne truth. And vvho are countenanced but ignorant and ſeditions teachers, vvho (like the Maſſe Prieſts of old) call mightily on the people for their plate and money for their patrons and themſelves? vvho, beſides their daily Pulpit treaſons, vent ſuch other Divinity, as if <hi>Luther</hi> vvere living, he vvould bluſh to call them Proteſtants: And if this be not cruelty, injuſtice, and tyranny, let God and poſterity judge. Mow for any looſeneſſe or incivility in our ſouldiers more then vvhat is incident and common to great Armies, I vviſh they vvould not mention it, leſt ſome impartiall readers, who know their courſes, underſtand it to be meant by ſome of their great Reformers, vvho are that way as notoriouſly guilty as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:158320:4"/>any: And for my ſelfe, I appeale to the conſciences of thoſe Lords and Gentlemen, vvho are my daily witneſſes, and to thoſe people vvhereſoever our Army hath been, vvhat they know, or have obſerved in my carriage, which might not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one of my quality, and the ſon of a King. And whereas they ſlander us for <hi>Popiſh Cavaliers,</hi> I vviſh there were no more Papiſts in their Army then vve have in ours; but to me tis no vvonder with what face they can ſlander us for men diſ-affected to the Proteſtant Religion, vvhen as their grand Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers refuſe to come to Church. For His ſacred Majeſty I have been a frequent vvitneſſe here in England (and all the world knowes he never ſhewed himſelf otherwiſe) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hold it to be my part and duty to tell them, that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty is the moſt faithfull and beſt defender of the Proteſtant Religion of any Chriſtian Prince in <hi>Europe,</hi> and is ſo accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all the Princes in Chriſtendome. And vvhat a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſupporter hath he been in particular to the Queene of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia</hi> (my vertuous Royall mother) and to the Prince Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, my Royall brother, no man can be ignorant of: if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in common gratitude I do my utmoſt in defence of His Majeſty, and that cauſe whereof hee hath hitherto been ſo great and happy a patron; no ingenuous man but muſt thinke it moſt reaſonable: And for my ſelfe, the vvorld knows how deeply I have ſmarted, and vvhat perils I have undergone for the Proteſtant cauſe, vvhat ſtately large promiſes vvere offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me vvould I conſent; and vvhat a wretched cloſe impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment vvas threatned, if I refuſed to change my Religion, vvhen I was captive to the Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> enough to ſatisfie any man of moderation: But if it be not ſufficient, I vvould to God all Engliſhmen were at union amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, then vvith what alacrity vvould I venture my life to ſerve this Kingdome againſt thoſe cruell Popiſh Rebels in Ireland: for though I will never fight in any unrighteous quarrell, yet to defend the King, Religion and Lawes of a Kingdome againſt ſubjects, who are up in armes againſt their Lord and Soveraigne, and ſuch (all good wiſe men know this
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:158320:5"/>and that of Ireland to be) though the pretence looke ſeverall waies; ſuch a cauſe my conſcience tells mee is full of piety and juſtice: and if it pleaſe God to end my daies in it, I ſhall thinke my laſt breath ſpent vvith as much honour and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if I were taken off my knees at my prayers. I thinke there is none that take me for a Coward; for ſure I feare not the face of any man alive, yet I ſhould repute it the greateſt victory in the vvorld to ſee His Majeſty enter London in peace, without ſhedding one drop of bloud: where, I dare ſay (God and His Majeſty are witneſſes I lye not) no Citizen ſhould be plundered of one penny or farthing, whereby that ancient and famous City would manifeſtly perceive how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately it hath been abuſed by moſt ſtrange, falſe and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe untruths, for which ſome body (without repentance) muſt be aſhamed at the day of Judgement, if they eſcape a condigne legall puniſhment in this world: I therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with this open profeſsion (and I am confident our whole Army will ſay <hi>Amen</hi> unto it) he that hath any deſigne againſt the Proteſtant Religion, the Lawes of England, or hopes to enrich himſelfe by pillaging the City of London, let him be accurſed: And ſo, whether peace or warre, the Lord proſper the worke of their hands who ſtand for GOD and King CHARLES.</p>
